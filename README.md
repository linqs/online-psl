# Online-PSL

Online Probabilistic soft logic (PSL) is a machine learning framework for developing online probabilistic models.
PSL models are easy to use and fast.
You can define models using the PSL syntax and solve them with fast online convex optimization.
More information about PSL is available at the [PSL homepage](https://psl.linqs.org).

Installing Online-PSL from Source
--------------------------

If you do want to install OnlinePSL from source, you can use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x.
In the top-level directory of the PSL source (which should be the same directory that holds this README), run:
```sh
mvn install
```
